      <h1>Hello, there!</h1>
      <p>
        Welcome to my first ever webpage!
      </p>
      <p>
        I am SlayingMantis and my coding journey began in January 2025 when I came across <a href="http://exercism.org">Exercism.org's</a> Coding Fundamentals Bootcamp. 
        I decided to take a leap of faith and enroll, unsure if I was going to be stuck in another beginner tutorial hell. 
      </p>
      <p>
        It turned to be a wonderfully-crafted learning experience with a vibrant community that was more than happy to welcome absolute beginners like myself. 
        Within a few weeks, I realized I was having so much fun learning the fundamentals of coding, I became addicted. 
        The rest is history.
      </p>
      <p>
        Below are some of the games that I learned to develop through my journey in the bootcamp. 
        So far, I've got one game, Breakout, running upto a reasonable level of functionality.
        I aim to add further features, like Highscores, advanced levels, etc., as I grow in my programming capabilities. 
        More games, like Snake, will also be added as time permits. 
      </p>
      <p>Hope you have fun playing! I had a blast making them!</p>
      <p>P.S. There maybe some bugs. They will be dealt with in future updates!</p>
